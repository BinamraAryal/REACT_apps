# Backend
This section of the repository houses the backend setup implemented with Node.js and MongoDB, forming the backbone of the E-commerce application.
# Structure:
- dbconfig: The repository for housing database configuration settings pertinent to MongoDB connectivity and other database-related configurations.
- controllers: This directory encapsulates the logic responsible for handling and processing diverse API endpoints, ensuring smooth data flow and business logic execution.
- models: Houses the definition of data models crucial for the application's functionality, ensuring consistency and structure within the database.
- routes: Manages the intricate web of backend API routes, establishing communication pathways for client-server interaction.
# Additional Components:
- CORS Middleware: The backend integrates the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware, facilitating secure communication between the frontend and backend, enabling controlled access to resources across different domains.
- Data Folder: Nestled within the server directory, the 'data' folder holds the databases used by MongoDB, housing essential data integral to the functioning of the application.
# Technology Utilized: 
- Node.js: Utilized as the core backend JavaScript runtime environment, enabling server-side execution of JavaScript code, handling requests, and managing the backend logic of the application.
- MongoDB: Deployed as the NoSQL database solution, proficiently storing and retrieving application data in a schema-less format, optimizing flexibility and scalability.
# Setup Instructions:
## - Configuration:
- Ensure proper configuration settings within the dbconfig directory, specifying MongoDB connection details and other database-related parameters.
## - Middleware Usage:
- The integration of CORS middleware ensures secure cross-origin communication. Configure CORS settings in the respective files within the backend to manage resource access between the frontend and backend.
## - Database Setup:
- Access the 'data' folder within the server directory to manage and maintain the MongoDB databases utilized by the application. Perform necessary backups or migrations as required.
## - Starting the Backend:
- Execute npm install to acquire essential dependencies.
- Launch the backend server using 'node (server_name.js)', ensuring MongoDB is operational or provide appropriate connection details in the configuration for seamless backend functionality.
